Managing Blueprints
-------------------

A Blueprint is a specific instance of an engineering Design Template that you build, deploy, and operate within your
network.  A typical use-case is the following:

   1. create a blueprint from a given design template
   2. build out the blueprint with specific parameter values
   3. assign specific devices to the blueprint
   4. deploy the blueprint onto the devices
   5. obtain operational values about the blueprint
